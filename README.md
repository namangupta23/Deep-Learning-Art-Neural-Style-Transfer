# Deep-Learning-Art-Neural-Style-Transfer

This notebook is a programming exercise of the Deep Learning Specialization by Deeplearning.ai. In this notebook, we will learn about Neural Style Transfer. This algorithm was created by [Gatys et al. (2015).](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576)

**In this assignment, we will:**

- Implement the neural style transfer algorithm
- Generate novel artistic images using your algorithm

Most of the algorithms optimize a cost function to get a set of parameter values. In Neural Style Transfer, we optimize a cost function to get pixel values.
